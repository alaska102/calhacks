Our CalHacks project is a Crisis Training Simulation designed to simulate realistic crisis scenarios using an interactive, conversational model. Inspired by Google Interview Prep, this project provides immersive crisis training across a variety of topics.

Technologies Used

Cartesia, OpenAI Whisper, and Google Gemini: These powerful tools enable dynamic, context-rich conversations that adapt to different crisis scenarios, providing users with unique training experiences.
React Native: Our frontend framework, allowing us to create a smooth, intuitive, and cross-platform user interface.
Flask: The backend framework that powers our application logic, handles data flow, and manages interactions between the frontend and AI tools.

Features


Dynamic Scenarios: Users can engage in interactive conversations tailored to specific crisis topics, building their skills through realistic practice.
AI-Driven Conversations: By integrating Cartesia and OpenAIâ€™s Whisper, our simulation generates responsive, adaptive dialogues for in-depth training.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Built with React Native, the app is accessible on both iOS and Android, making it convenient for users on any mobile device.
